==========

Anki 2.x add-on that helps using with the touch interface.

(todo: Animated gif will be here!!)


## Description

I have a problem which is hard to use Anki 2.x with touch on the Microsoft Surface Pro 3.

This addon aims for easy to use on touch devices.

Inspired by [Tinder] and [mikan].


## Requirements

* [Anki] 2.0 or lator
* Windows 8.1 with the touch interface.
    * Perhaps, it will be able to use at linux desktop.


## How to use

When you see the front of card...

* **Press screen** to `Show answer`.
* Keep it and **swipe left** to `Good`, it means **CORRECT!, REMEBERED!**
* Or, **swipe right** to `Again`, it means **MISS, FORGOTTEN**


## Install

**Not uploaded to ankiweb.net for easy to install yet** 


1. Download [anki-touch.py], then save it to the addons' folder.

    The addons' folder is...

    * Windows 8.1: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\Anki\addons\
    * Ubuntu Linux 12.04: ~/Anki/addons/

2. Start or restart Anki
